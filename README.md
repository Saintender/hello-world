Demonstrative repository for practice purposes.

About the author - I'm a math teacher highly interested in programming. I've begun work on videogames and hobby-type programs but really looking for a greater challenge.

This repository will find it's use shortly as I begin to teach two new comers to our development team the in's and out's of OOP.
